# `watch`

This script will watch folders and copy files to a destination when
they change.

## Configure

`watch.coffee` expects a file called `config.json` that looks like
`config_example.json`.  Everyone has different paths â€” so don't check
in your `config.json` to this repo.

## Install and run:

```
> npm install
> coffee watch.coffee
```
